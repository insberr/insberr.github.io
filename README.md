* [ ] Use javascript for the user name display

* [ ] Fix the progress bar css

* [ ] Move the secret code to a differant place

* [ ] Add info to the About tab

* [x] Fix the l and k characters not decoding on the secret code
* There was an error with the ' and ’ (k) and the " and ” (l)

* I've mostly got this done, just need to add the rest of the variables and copy and paste a lot of things.

* [ ] Fix button padding on the left and right

* Honestly, the default style looks ugly, and my style, was me playing with it, looks terrible.
