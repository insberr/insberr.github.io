# My Personal Website | Gitlab
Welcome to the code for my personal website! Its a working progress, but ill get it worked out.

Wow, coding is a lot of work.

# To Do

* [ ] Add settings reset button

* [ ] Add a local storage deleter button

* [x] Fix the color set not saving or setting when you reload

* [x] Fix the l and k characters not decoding on the secret code
* There was an error with the ' and ’ (k) and the " and ” (l)

* [ ] Use JavaScript to make lists easier to organize 
* I've mostly got this done, just need to add the rest of the variables and copy and paste a lot of things.

* [ ] Fix button padding on the left and right

* [ ] Redesign the input boxes
* Honestly, the default style looks ugly, and my style, was me playing with it, looks terrable.

* [x] Use textarea for secret code inputs
* Done! it looks a little better. There is more design to do, but i will do it later.
